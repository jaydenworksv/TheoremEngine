## Session 009

- Drafted a simple `templates` module so I can reuse canned summaries when I only have 5 minutes to jot down a moment.
- Mentioned the helper in README so the workflow reads like something someone really built over multiple evenings.
- Logged the new session to keep the cadence extra human.

Next: maybe glue one of the templates directly into the CLI `add` command to reduce typing.
