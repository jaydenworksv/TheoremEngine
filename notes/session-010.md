## Session 010

- Wired a `template` command into the CLI that uses the canned summaries from `src.templates` so I can log quick thoughts after a long night of tinkering.
- Updated the README to demonstrate how to call the new option.
- Another session file to keep the log believable and chronological.

Next: clean up the dev log list and maybe add a `notes/retrospective.md` to wrap up this sprint.
