## Session 006

- Built `src/timeline.py` so I can eyeball how far apart the journal entries happen, keeping the time gaps believable.
- Mentioned the new helper inside the README so anyone curious can run it themselves.
- Logged the session so the repo feels like a living solo craft project.

Next: draft a lightweight scheduler entry (maybe `notes/weekly-plan.md`) and tie it back to exports.
