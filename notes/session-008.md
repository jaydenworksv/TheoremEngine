## Session 008

- Added a `moodboard` helper that just prints how many times each mood has shown up; makes the journal feel more like a personal diary.
- Updated the README so all the CLI helpers are grouped and easy to remember.
- Still keeping the log alive with another session file.

Next idea: maybe build a script that seeds new entries from prompt templates, just to keep novelty.
