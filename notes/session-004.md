## Session 004

- Built `src/exporter.py` so I can turn the JSON journal into markdown snippets without opening a fancy UI.
- Added a sample exported doc in `exports/journal-summary.md` and hooked the exporter module to run from the samples directory.
- Noted that gentle summaries plus the CLI still keep the project feeling like a lightweight solo notebook.

Next target: more command helpers (search/filter) while keeping the commit cadence deliberate.
