## Session 007

- Added `src/scheduler.py` so SignalWeave can suggest calm weekend slots after the last entry, keeping the timeline believable.
- Updated the README to list the scheduler command alongside the exporter/reports helpers.
- Logged another solo session to show the repo is evolving steadily.

Next: maybe wire a tiny diary CLI that prompts to capture moods or a template for manual writing.
