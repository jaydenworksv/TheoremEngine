## Session 001

- Project: SignalWeave – idea sparked while reviewing AI trading notebooks. Need a lightweight CLI and simple JSON storage.
- Tasks: outline schema, plan CLI commands, note where exports will live.
- Thoughts: keep metadata explicit (signal type, reasoning, confidence, tags).

This session focuses on writing the intent down so future commits feel grounded.
