## Session 003

- Added `src/reports.py` to summarize journal data so SignalWeave can spit out quick tag/mood counts without a full UI.
- Hooked the module to print from `samples/journal-template.json` when run directly, keeping the experience consistent with CLI explorations.
- Updated docs to call out the reporting helper and kept the dev log going, as requested.

Next: draft a lightweight export script to push selected entries into a CSV-style format for offline notes.
