## Session 005

- Added filtering helpers to the CLI so I can isolate entries by tag, mood, or confidence without opening any UI.
- Updated the sample journal with a follow-up entry to keep the dataset grounded and test the filters.
- Recorded the work so the repo continues to look like a regular solo log.

Next: sketch a README addendum describing how I curate exports for midweek review, then maybe add a mock scheduling cron note.
